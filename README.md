# Dice Simulator with Animation

## Description
This **Dice Simulator with Animation** is a Python project that creates an interactive dice rolling experience using **Tkinter** for the graphical user interface (GUI) and **Pillow** (PIL) for image handling. The program displays an animated sequence of changing dice faces before showing the final result. Additionally, the outcome is printed to the console as soon as it is determined, allowing for real-time feedback.

## Features
- **Interactive GUI**: Click anywhere in the window to roll the dice.
- **Animated Roll**: The dice face changes in a sequence to create an animation effect before revealing the final result.
- **Immediate Output**: The rolled outcome is printed to the console as soon as the final value is determined.
- **Customizable Images**: Uses images of dice faces for a realistic visual experience.
- **Simple and Fun**: Easy to use, perfect for game development and educational purposes.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**: The programming language used for this project.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Python Imaging Library for loading and manipulating images.
- **Tkinter**: Python's built-in library for creating GUI applications.

### Installing Prerequisites
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
